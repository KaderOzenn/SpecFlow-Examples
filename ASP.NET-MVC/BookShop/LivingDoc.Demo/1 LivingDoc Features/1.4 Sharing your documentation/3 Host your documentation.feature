Feature: 3 Host your documentation
If you used the CLI tool to generate stand alone LivingDoc then keep in mind that the generated HTML is a single page application 
with no external dependencies, so you can share it as you wish.

The possible sharing options depend on your current infrastructure setup and needs, but here are some ideas:

- Any file sharing solution (Windows file share, Sharpoint, Dropbox etc.)
- Hosting the generated HTML with any of the static HTML hosting services such as Azure Blob Storage and AWS

You can read more about the publishing possibilities [here](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc/en/latest/LivingDocGenerator/sharing-and-publishing.html).
