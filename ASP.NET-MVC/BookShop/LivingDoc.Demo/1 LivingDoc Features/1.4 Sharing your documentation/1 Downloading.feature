Feature: 1 Downloading
When using the Azure DevOps extension SpecFlow+ LivingDoc an *additional button* appears next to the title.
With that, you can download your Living Documentation from Azure DevOps as a stand-alone HTML file
to share it with team members who do not use AzureDevOps.

*Note: The downloaded Living Documentation will not have a Repository selector, nor a Branch selector.
It will contain the data from your selected Repository and Branch.*
