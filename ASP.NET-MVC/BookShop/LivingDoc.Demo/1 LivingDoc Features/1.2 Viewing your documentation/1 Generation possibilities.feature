Feature: 1 Generation possibilities
SpecFlow+LivingDoc gives you the option to generate & share living documentation in two configurable ways:

- **SpecFlow+LivingDoc In Azure DevOps**: If your team uses Azure DevOps then we suggest installing our dedicated extension to help you generate and share LivingDoc within the familiar Azure DevOps interface. Learn how to set it up [here](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc/en/latest/Installation/Installation.html#).
- **SpecFlow+LivingDoc Generator**: If you want to generate a self-hosted HTML documentation with no external dependencies so you have the freedom to share it as you wish, then we suggest the SpecFlow plugin and command-line tool. Learn how to set it up [here](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc/en/latest/LivingDocGenerator/Generating-Documentation.html).

In both versions you also have the option to generate documentation **with** or **without test results**.
