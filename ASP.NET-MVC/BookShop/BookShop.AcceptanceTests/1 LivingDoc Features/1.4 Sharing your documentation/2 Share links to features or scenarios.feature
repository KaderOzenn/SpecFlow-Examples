Feature: 2 Share links to features or scenarios
Team collaboration with **SpecFlow+Living Azure DevOps extension** is as easy as just giving access to team members in Azure DevOps. They can view it under the “Overview” tab.

The SpecFlow+Living Azure DevOps extension also gives you the option to quickly **create links to Feature Files and Scenarios** in Azure DevOps.
You can do this by clicking on the share icon next to each title which copies the URL of the selected feature or scenario to the clipboard. 
This is equivalent to copying the link from the browser bar.
You can then share this link with anyone who has access to the project in Azure DevOps.

When using the **SpecFlow+ LivingDoc Generator**, you can also share links to a specific Feature or Scenario by **copying the link from the browser bar**.
