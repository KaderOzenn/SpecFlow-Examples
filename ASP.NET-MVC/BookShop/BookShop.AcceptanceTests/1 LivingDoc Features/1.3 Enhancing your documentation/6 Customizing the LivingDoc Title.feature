Feature: 6 Customizing the LivingDoc Title
You can individually configure the title of your Living Documentation.. 

Azure DevOps Pipelines provides a rich set of variables like the branch name and commit message. 
Any of these variables can be used as part of the document title.

Additionally the SpecFlow+ LivingDoc Generator offers as well a parameter in the CLI tool where you can customize the title.

You can read more about how to configure it [here](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc/en/latest/Guides/Title-branch-name.html).
